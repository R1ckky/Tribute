          While Reeves was attending Northern Arizona University, he released his first video on YouTube, The
          Robot That Shines a Laser in Your Eye, which went viral. His subsequent videos included a Roomba
          that swore upon colliding with a wall, a taser camera that shocked its subjects, a Twitter bot that
          purchased items from the replies that received the most likes, and a modification of Boston
          Dynamicsâ€™s robot dog, Spot, that urinated beer into a cup on command.

          In December 2019, it was announced that Reeves had joined OfflineTV, a collection of Twitch
          streamers creating content and living together in Los Angeles, California. In June 2020, Reeves
          began streaming on Twitch, where he streams both video games and technology work. His debut stream
          attracted over 30,000 concurrent viewers. He now has a little over 6.7M subscribers on Youtube and
          1.5 followers on Twitch.
