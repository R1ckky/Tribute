              While Reeves was attending Northern Arizona University, he released his first video on YouTube, The Robot That Shines a Laser in Your Eye, which went viral. His subsequent videos included a Roomba that swore upon colliding with a wall, a taser camera that shocked its subjects, a Twitter bot that purchased items from the replies that received the most likes, and a modification of Boston Dynamicsâ€™s robot dog Spot that urinated beer into a cup on command.
